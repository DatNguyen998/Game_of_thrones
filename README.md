This is simply an idea to evaluate some characters in GoT.

Create the Radar chart for some of the fav characters in GoT.
characters = {
    "Jon Snow": [9, 8, 4, 7, 7, 9, 6],
    "Tywin Lannister": [9, 6, 8, 10, 9, 9, 9],
    "Varys": [7, 2, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8],
    "Arya Stark": [6, 10, 7, 7, 6, 8, 5],
    "Sansa Stark": [7, 2, 8, 8, 8, 9, 7]
}

Use ChatGpt to evaluate characters based on their traits and giving relevant scores.
Finally, using Matlab to create a Radar Chart.
